**Task**: Goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with.

**Implementation**:
- Perform EDA and any data cleaning if necessary.
- Implement Feature Scaling to Normalize the data
- Find optimal number of features using RFECV 
- Implement KMeans Clustering and based on elbow method identify what is the optimum number of clusters
- Implement PCA with number of original features to answer how much variance is explained by first 2 components and by first 4 components and visualize the clusters in the data
- Implement XGBoost Classifier with 5 Fold CV and report the performance metrics
